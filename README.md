Linux Config files for non-sensitive facets

Some of my main linux config files for operation critical things. 

![Clean homescreen](2017-04-21-132147_1920x1080_scrot.png "Clean Homescreen")

![Tiling](2017-04-21-132252_1920x1080_scrot.png "Terminal Screen")

What can I say, I like my tiling window manager to play well with everything else.
